## Company technologies
- WEB FRAMEWORKS
We turbocharge our development process with state of the art frameworks such as Yii, Django, Symfony, Spring, Java and Node.js.

- RESPONSIVE DESIGN
At Scopic we believe it’s not about the size but what you do with it. With technologies like Bootstrap and LESS, there’s not a screen size we don’t love.

- NATIVE/CROSS-PLATFORM SDKS
We’re not tied down by a single platform; we like to play the field. We use Xamarin, AdobeAIR, PhoneGAP and Qt to cater to different operating systems.

- OPENGL, DIRECT3D
We are experts in standard 3D design. We utilize computer vision libraries such as OpenGL, OpenCV and DirectD3.

- SQL AND NOSQL DATABASES
Scopic has a foot in both worlds. We use tried and true SQL when the fit is right, but aren’t afraid to delve into newer technologies like Hadoop, MongoDB, Dynamo and other applications for big data.

## Office locations
